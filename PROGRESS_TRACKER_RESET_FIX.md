# Progress Tracker Reset Issue - FIXED âœ…

## Problem
Progress tracker showing 100% and all steps completed when page loads fresh.

## Root Cause
Old workflow state was saved in browser's localStorage from previous sessions. The tracker was loading this old state instead of starting fresh.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Auto-Reset on Home Page
Added logic to automatically reset progress when visiting the home/index page:

```javascript
// Check if we're on the home/index page - reset if so
const currentPath = window.location.pathname;
const isHomePage = currentPath === '/' || currentPath.endsWith('index.html') || currentPath.endsWith('/');

if (isHomePage) {
    console.log('[GlobalProgressTracker] On home page - resetting to initial state');
    this.resetState();
}
```

### 2. Fixed Overall Progress Calculation
Changed from showing raw `percentage` to calculating actual overall progress:

```javascript
// Calculate overall progress (0-100% across all 3 steps)
// Each step = 33.33%, current step progress adds partial
let overallProgress = 0;

// Count completed steps (each worth 33.33%)
const completedCount = this.completedSteps.length;
overallProgress += completedCount * 33.33;

// Add current step's partial progress
if (this.stepStatus[this.currentStep] === 'current') {
    overallProgress += (this.percentage * 0.3333);
}

// Cap at 100%
overallProgress = Math.min(100, Math.round(overallProgress));
```

**Before**: Showed whatever `this.percentage` was (could be 100% from old state)
**After**: Calculates based on completed steps + current progress

### 3. Updated Step Completion Logic
Fixed the max step number from 4 to 3:

```javascript
if (this.currentStep < 3) {  // Was: < 4
    this.updateStep(this.currentStep, 'completed', 100);
    this.updateStep(this.currentStep + 1, 'current', 0);
} else {
    this.updateStep(3, 'completed', 100);  // Was: 4
}
```

## Manual Reset Methods

### Method 1: Refresh Home Page
Simply go to the home page (/) and refresh. The tracker will automatically reset.

### Method 2: Console Command
Open browser console (F12) and run:

```javascript
// Option A: Simple reset
GlobalProgressTracker.resetState();
GlobalProgressTracker.updateUI();

// Option B: Complete reset with page reload
localStorage.removeItem('etl_global_progress');
location.reload();

// Option C: Check current state
console.log(GlobalProgressTracker.getState());
```

### Method 3: Clear Browser Data
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Expand "Local Storage"
4. Find `etl_global_progress`
5. Right-click â†’ Delete
6. Refresh page

## Expected Behavior Now

### On Home Page Load:
```
Progress: 0%
Step 1: Upload - Active (blue, pulsing)
Step 2: Preview - Pending (gray)
Step 3: Transform - Pending (gray)
```

### After Uploading File:
```
Progress: 33%
Step 1: Upload - Completed (âœ“ checkmark)
Step 2: Preview - Active (blue, pulsing)
Step 3: Transform - Pending (gray)
```

### On Preview Page (50% through step 2):
```
Progress: 50% (33% from step 1 + 16.5% from half of step 2)
Step 1: Upload - Completed (âœ“)
Step 2: Preview - Active (blue)
Step 3: Transform - Pending (gray)
```

### On Transform Page:
```
Progress: 67%
Step 1: Upload - Completed (âœ“)
Step 2: Preview - Completed (âœ“)
Step 3: Transform - Active (blue, pulsing)
```

### After Transform Complete:
```
Progress: 100%
Step 1: Upload - Completed (âœ“)
Step 2: Preview - Completed (âœ“)
Step 3: Transform - Completed (âœ“)
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Clear existing state:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('etl_global_progress');
   ```

2. **Refresh home page** - Should see:
   - Progress bar at 0%
   - "Upload Excel Workbook" label
   - Step 1 active (blue + pulsing)
   - Steps 2 & 3 gray

3. **Upload a file** - Progress should jump to ~33%

4. **Navigate to preview** - Progress should be 33-66% range

5. **Navigate to transform** - Progress should be 66-100% range

## Debugging

If you still see 100% on load, check console for these messages:

```
[GlobalProgressTracker] Initializing sticky progress tracker...
[GlobalProgressTracker] On home page - resetting to initial state
[GlobalProgressTracker] State reset to initial
[GlobalProgressTracker] State saved: {currentStep: 1, percentage: 0, ...}
```

If you DON'T see "On home page - resetting to initial state", the path detection might not be working. Check:

```javascript
console.log('Current path:', window.location.pathname);
```

Expected values:
- `/` 
- `/index.html`
- `/home`

## Summary

âœ… **Auto-reset** when visiting home page  
âœ… **Accurate progress** calculation (0-100% across 3 steps)  
âœ… **Fixed step count** (3 steps instead of 4)  
âœ… **Manual reset** commands available  

**No more 100% progress on fresh load!** ðŸŽ‰
