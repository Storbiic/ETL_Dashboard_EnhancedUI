# ✅ 4-Step Progress Tracker - Downloads Phase Added

## New Workflow Structure

The progress tracker now has **4 complete steps** to match the entire user journey including the results/downloads page:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [1] Upload ──── [2] Preview ──── [3] Transform ──── [4] Downloads         │
│   📤 Upload      📊 Preview        ⚙️ Transform      📥 Download           │

## Progress Calculation

### Formula
- **Each step** = 25% of total progress
- **Current step partial** = (step_percentage × 0.25)
- **Overall** = (completed_steps × 25) + current_step_partial

### Examples

| Completed Steps | Current Step | Step % | Overall % |
|-----------------|--------------|--------|-----------|
| 0 | 1 (Upload) | 0% | 0% |
| 0 | 1 (Upload) | 50% | 12.5% |
| 0 | 1 (Upload) | 100% | 25% |
| 1 | 2 (Preview) | 0% | 25% |
| 1 | 2 (Preview) | 50% | 37.5% |
| 1 | 2 (Preview) | 100% | 50% |
| 2 | 3 (Transform) | 0% | 50% |
| 2 | 3 (Transform) | 50% | 62.5% |
| 2 | 3 (Transform) | 100% | 75% |
| 3 | 4 (Downloads) | 0% | 75% |
| 3 | 4 (Downloads) | 50% | 87.5% |
| 4 | - | - | 100% |

## Visual Design Updates

### Responsive Sizing (4 steps = slightly smaller icons)
- **Mobile (<640px)**: 36px icons (w-9 h-9)
- **Tablet (640-768px)**: 44px icons (w-11 h-11)
- **Desktop (>768px)**: 48px icons (w-12 h-12)

**Note**: Icons slightly reduced from 3-step layout to accommodate 4 steps in single line

### Step Widths
- Each step container: **20%** of width
- Each connector: **16%** of width (max-width)
- Ensures perfect horizontal alignment

### Icons
| Step | Icon | FontAwesome Class |
|------|------|-------------------|
| 1 | 📤 | `fa-cloud-upload-alt` |
| 2 | 📊 | `fa-chart-line` |
| 3 | ⚙️ | `fa-cogs` |
| 4 | 📥 | `fa-download` |

---

## Auto-Advancement Logic

### Transform → Downloads Transition
When transform completes (step 4 in old code = step 3 in new code):

```javascript
// In global-progress-sync.js
if (step === 4 && status === 'completed') {
    // Transform done, move to Downloads step
    window.GlobalProgressTracker.updateStep(4, 'current', 0);
}
```

This automatically advances the tracker to "Downloads" when the transform finishes.

---

## Backward Compatibility

Old `app.js` code still calls with internal 5-step numbering. The sync script maps:

```javascript
// Old app.js internal steps → New tracker steps
1: Upload       → 1: Upload
2: Select       → 2: Preview
3: Profile      → 2: Preview (merged, 50-100%)
4: Transform    → 3: Transform
5: Downloads    → 4: Downloads
```
